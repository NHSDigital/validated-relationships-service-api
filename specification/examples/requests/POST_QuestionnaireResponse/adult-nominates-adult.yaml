QuestionnaireResponseAdultNominatesAdultRequest:
  summary: Adult nominates Adult access request
  description: |
    Example proxy access request from an adult (Jill) with NHS number `9000000006` nominating her husband (Tom) with NHS number `9000000005` to act on her behalf.

    Significant things to point out:

    - `source.type` should be `Patient` when a patient is nominating a proxy
    - `source.identifier.value` should be the NHS number of the user completing the form - this should correlate with the Identity token in the request
    - `subject.type` should be `Patient` since it is the patient that is the subject of the application
    - `subject.identifier.value` should be the NHS Number of the patient to which the application relates
    - `relatedPerson` demographics are present in the request as a result of being provided by the applicant
