  title: 'Validated Relationships Service API'
  version: '1.1.0'
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the Validated Relationships Service - the national electronic database of relationships
    that have been verified for the purpose of enabling citizens to access patient facing services on behalf of
    (as a proxy for) patients they care for.

    The relationships held by this service are strictly for the purpose of enabling access to healthcare services.
    This is in contrast to the relationships held by the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), which are largely to
    support the provision of direct care.

    You can:

    - get validated relationships (to support decision making when granting proxy access)

    In the future you will be able to:

    - create a new proxy access request
    - update a proxy access request
    - update a validated proxy relationship
    - delete (revoke) a validated proxy relationship

    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have this and a valid use case before
    you go too far with your development by [contacting us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)

    You must do this before you can go live (see 'Onboarding' below).

    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs are related to this API:

    - [Personal Demographics Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - we use the data held in PDS as a source of data to verify relationships.

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    If you would like to be involved in our beta programme, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ### Roadmap
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=vrs-api).

    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level
    This API is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [UK.core.r4 1.0.0](https://simplifier.net/packages/uk.core.r4/1.0.0).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/RelatedPerson` not `/relatedpersons`
    - array names are singular, for example `name` not `names` for the recorded names of a patient

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.

    The end user must be:
    * a patient who receives health and social care or makes use of NHS services
    * strongly authenticated, using [NHS login](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login)

    To use this access mode, use one of the following security patterns:

    |	Security pattern		                                                                                                                                                                                                          |	Technical details	                                  |	Advantages	                                                | Disadvantages                                           |

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

        ## Overview
        For any new access request, the necessary details should be collected from a user facing service e.g. 
        Proxy Access Service and submitted as a QuestionnaireResponse. 
        
        For the most part demographics information doesn't need to be provided in the access request since it can be pulled from PDS.

        Use this endpoint to get validated relationships for a proxy with a given NHS Number.

        You can (optionally) include `patient:identifier={nhsNumber}` request parameter with the patient's NHS number to get a specific validated relationship for the proxy.

        You can (optionally) include the `_include=RelatedPerson:patient` request parameter to include the patient's details in the operation response.
